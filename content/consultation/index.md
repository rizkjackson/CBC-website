## Rates

developing grant proposals and writing clinical research protocols is

We provide consultation up to one hour per project at no cost.
Consultation beyond one hour, and all data analyses, are handled
through a recharge mechanism.  For smaller projects, we charge on an
hourly basis.  For larger projects, we prefer to be paid on a
percentage-effort basis.
