## Activities

<%--- Exactly what does the below mean? Does it mean that we do grant
proposal for free? ---%> 

Our activities include, but are not limited to:
* scientific consultation
* study design
* data analysis 
* software development
* grant assistance
* manuscript assistance

Our resources are prioritized toward [members] of the UCSF Helen Diller
Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.
As time permits, we also provide support to investigators in the wider
UCSF organisation (including its [affiliates]) as well as researchers
outside of the UCSF.


## Charges

We provide consultation of up to one hour per project at no cost.
Consultations beyond one hour, and all data analyses, are handled
through a recharge mechanism.
For smaller projects, we charge on an hourly basis.
For larger collaborative projects, payment on a percentage-effort
basis is prefered.
**Grant assistance to Cancer Center members is always free of
charge.**

* Internal users are funded by UCSF sources (or other UC campus
  sources) and provide a valid fund-DPA for payment.  Affiliate users
  are funded by non-UC sources and pay by check, but the funding is
  provided by a recognized UCSF affiliate (SFGH, SFVAMC, NCIRE, Gallo,
  Gladstone, HHMI, or LBNL). External users are funded by non-UC
  sources and pay by check.
