# Consultation

## Rates

<%--- Exactly what does the below mean? Does it mean that we do grant
proposal for free? ---%> 

Our activities include, but are not limited to, scientific
consultation, study design, data analysis, software development and
grant and manuscript assistance.

Grant assistance to Cancer Center members is covered by the _Cancer
Center Support Grant_.  For other projects, we provide consultation of
up to one hour per project at no cost.  Consultations beyond one hour,
and all data analyses, are handled through a recharge mechanism.  For
smaller projects, we charge on an hourly basis.  For larger projects,
we prefer to be paid on a percentage-effort basis.

Our resources are prioritized toward members of the UCSF Helen Diller
Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, but as time permits, we also
provide consultation to other UCSF investigators.
