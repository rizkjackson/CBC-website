# Consultation

## Activities

<%--- Exactly what does the below mean? Does it mean that we do grant
proposal for free? ---%> 

Our activities include, but are not limited to:
* scientific consultation
* study design
* data analysis 
* software development
* grant assistance
* manuscript assistance

## Charges

We provide consultation of up to one hour per project at no cost.
Consultations beyond one hour, and all data analyses, are handled
through a recharge mechanism.  For smaller projects, we charge on an
hourly basis.  For larger collaborative projects, we prefer to be paid
on a percentage-effort basis.

Grant assistance to Cancer Center members is free.

Our resources are prioritized toward members of the UCSF Helen Diller
Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, but as time permits, we also
provide support to other UCSF investigators.
