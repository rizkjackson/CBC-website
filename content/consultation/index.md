## Rates
We provide consultation up to one hour per project at no cost.
Consultation beyond one hour, and all data analyses, are handled
through a recharge mechanism.

Assistance to Cancer Center members in developing grant proposals and
writing clinical research protocols is covered by
_Cancer Center Support Grant_ funds.

A large portion of Core activities, however, is funded from grants
that include data analysts as part of their budget.  The Core
encourages this practice for grants that will require substantial
assistance; in such cases, recharges are on a percentage-effort basis.

* Internal users are funded by UCSF sources (or other UC campus
  sources) and provide a valid fund-DPA for payment.  Affiliate users
  are funded by non-UC sources and pay by check, but the funding is
  provided by a recognized UCSF affiliate (SFGH, SFVAMC, NCIRE, Gallo,
  Gladstone, HHMI, or LBNL). External users are funded by non-UC
  sources and pay by check.
