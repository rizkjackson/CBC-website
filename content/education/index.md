# Education

Faculty and staff are available to give short presentations on topics such as:

* Determining quality of your microarray and HT-Seq data
* What clustering can and can not do for you
* Building a predictor
* Introduction to the R statistical software

Feel free to drop in on one of us if you have questions on any topic related to computational biology.

Our educational mission also includes the Quantitative Biology
Discussion Group.  This montly gathering, usually on the first
Thursday of the month at 3pm in HD291, is an opportunity for members
of the Cancer Center community to present their genomic data analyses
in an informal setting.
