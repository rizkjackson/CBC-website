# High Performance Computing (HPC)

At the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center we have a
large Linux compute cluster that is available to anyone affiliated
with the Cancer Center.  The cluster is maintained by our
core&nbsp;<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup> - feel free to
[contact] us if you would like to join or have questions.

As of February 2016, the cluster has 26 nodes and 1000+ cores where
the smaller nodes have 32 GiB of RAM and the larger ones have 512 GiB
of RAM.  It uses PBS/Torque
