Welcome to the UCSF Computational Biology Core.

Our objective is to provide state-of-the-art statistical and
computational biology support for cancer-related research at UCSF.
We have expertise in genetics, bioinformatics, computer science and
statistics with long-term experience in high-throughput sequencing and
microarray analysis, pathway analysis and systems biology.
Our activities include, but are not limited to, scientific
consultation, grant and manuscript development, study design
and data analysis.

Our resources are prioritized toward members of the UCSF Helen Diller
Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, but as time permits, we also
provide consultation other UCSF investigators. If you believe we can
be of help to you, feel free to drop by on the second floor or grab us
in the hallway.  You can of course also contact us by email or phone.
