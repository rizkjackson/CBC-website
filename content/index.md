Welcome to the UCSF Computational Biology Core.

Our objective is to provide state-of-the-art computational biology
support for cancer-related research at UCSF.  We have expertise in
genetics, bioinformatics, computer science and statistics with
long-term experience in high-throughput sequencing, microarrays, and
other genomic and proteomic technologies.  Our activities include, but
are not limited to, scientific consultation, study design, data
analysis, and grant and manuscript development.

Our resources are prioritized toward members of the UCSF Helen Diller
Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, but as time permits, we also
provide consultation to other UCSF investigators. If you believe we
can be of help to you, feel free to drop by one of our office or grab
us in the hallway.  You can of course schedule a meeting by email or
phone.
