Welcome to the UCSF Computational Biology Core.

Our objective is to provide appropriate state-of-the-art statistical
and computational biology support for cancer-related research at UCSF.
Our resources are prioritize toward members of the
UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, but as time
permits, we also provide consultation other UCSF investigators.

We have expertise in genetics, bioinformatics, computer science and
statistics and long-term experience high-throughput sequencing and
microarray analysis, pathway analysis and systems biology.
Our activities include, but are not limited to, scientific
consultation, grant and manuscript development, study design
and data analysis.

If you believe we can be of help, feel free to drop by on the
second floor or grab us in the hallway.  You can of course also
