* **Saurabh Asthana**, PhD, is an associate researcher at the UCSF
  Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. Saurabh did his
  graduate work in evolutionary biology/genomics at Harvard Medical
  School in old Boston town.  Prior to joining the Computational
  Biology Core, he labored on behalf of the Bivona and Taylor labs at
  UCSF, analyzing exomes, whole genomes, transcriptomes, ribosomes, a
  smattering of genetic screens, etc. Most of his time is spent
  tooling on various next-generation sequencing analysis pipelines.

* **Henrik Bengtsson**, PhD, is an Assistant Professor in Residence in
  the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. He obtained
  his MSc (Computer Science) and PhD (Mathematical Statistics) from
  Lund University in Sweden. Before joining the UCSF faculty, he did
  postdoctoral research at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of
  Medical Research in Melbourne and at the University of California at
  Berkeley. He has extensive experience in computational biology, with
  a focus on applications of copy-number analysis to cancer genomics
  research.  He has recently developed the aroma.seq tools for
  analyzing new-generation sequencing data.

* **Adam Olshen**, PhD and Director of the Core, is Professor In
  Residence in the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and
  Biostatistics. Dr. Olshen received his PhD in Biostatistics from the
  University of Washington. His expertise is in cancer genomics. He is
  particularly known for methods of DNA copy number analysis, having
  co-developed the popular CBS algorithm.  More recently, he has
  worked on methods for integrating multiple types of genomic data and
  for analyzing ribosome profiling data. He has extensive experience
  in the analysis of genomic, proteomic, and other types of
  high-throughput biological data.

* **Ritu Roy**, MSc, is a staff scientist at the UCSF Helen Diller
  Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. Mrs. Roy has a Master's degree
  in Computer Science from Dibrugarh University, India and the same in
  Biostatistics from UC Berkeley. As a computational biologist at
  UCSF, she has ten years of experience analyzing high-throughput
  genomic data.  Prior to coming to UCSF, she was a software engineer
  for seven years.

* **Mark Segal**, PhD, is Professor In Residence in the UCSF
  Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and Head of the
  Division of Bioinformatics.  Dr. Segal received his PhD in
  Statistics from Stanford University.  He has worked on a diverse
  suite of computational biology problems including methods for
  linking high-throughput expression data to survival endpoints, novel
  topologies for representing protein folding and elicitation of gene
  regulatory networks.  Currently, he is principal investigator of an
  R01 pertaining to inferring and utilizing 3D genome architecture.
