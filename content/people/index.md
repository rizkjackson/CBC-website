* Ritu Roy, MSc, is a member of the Computational Biology of UCSF HDFCCC
  Computational Biology Shared Resource. Mrs. Roy has Master's
  degrees in Computer Science from Dibrugarh University, India and in
  Biostatistics from UC Berkeley. As a biostatistician, she has ten
  years of experience in analysis of high-throughput genomic data at
  UCSF, prior to which she had been a software engineer for seven
  years.  [Contact Ritu](/contact/index.html)

* Henrik Bengtsson, PhD, is an Assistant Professor in Residence in the
  UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics as well as a
  member of the Computational Biology of UCSF HDFCCC Computational
  Biology Shared Resource. He obtained his MSc (Computer Science) and
  PhD (Mathematical Statistics) from Lund University in Sweden. Before
  joining the UCSF faculty, he did postdoctoral research at Walter and
  Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne and at
  University of California at Berkeley. He has extensive experience in
  computational biology, with a focus on applications of copy-number
  analysis to cancer genomics research.  He has recently developed the
  aroma.seq tools for analyzing new-generation sequencing data.

* Adam Olshen, PhD and Director of the Core, is Professor In Residence
  in the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Dr. Olshen
  received his PhD in Biostatistics from the University of
  Washington. His expertise is in cancer genomics. He is particularly
  known for methods of DNA copy number analysis, having co-developed
  the popular CBS algorithm.  More recently, he has worked on methods
  for integrating multiple types of genomic data and for analyzing
  ribosome profiling data. He has extensive experience in the analysis
  of genomic, proteomic, and other types of high-throughput biological
  data.  [Contact Adam](/contact/index.html)
