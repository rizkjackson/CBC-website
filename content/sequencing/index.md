# Sequencing

We have developed robust sequencing pipelines for the following cases:

* DNA copy number, either total copy number or parent-specific
* RNA sequencing
* Exome Sequencing
* Ribosome Profiling

We develop new pipelines as needed, so feel free to come to us with
other types of data.  We typically run these analyses on the large
[compute cluster] here at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive
Cancer Center.
