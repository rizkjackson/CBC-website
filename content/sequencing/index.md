# Sequencing, microarrays, and other technologies

We have the expertice and the capabilities of analyzing data from a
wide variety of "omics" technologies, sources and brands, including
high-throughput sequencing, microarrays and imaging to name a few.
For example:

* High-throughput sequencing (HT-Seq):
 - DNA-Seq
 - RNA-Seq
 - Exome-Seq
 - Ribosome Profiling
* Microarrays:
 - Gene expression arrays
 - Exon arrays
 - Genotyping arrays
 - Copy number arrays

If you need help analyzing these or other types of data, don't
hesitate to [contact] us. We are here to support you And your research.

We also have long-term experience in methods and pipeline development,
which sometimes is needed, particularly in novel research projects.
We typically run these analyses on the large [compute cluster] here at
the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.
