# Sequencing, microarrays, and other technologies

We have the expertise and the capabilities of analyzing data from a
wide variety of "omics" technologies, sources and brands, including
high-throughput sequencing, microarrays and imaging to name a few.
These include:

* High-throughput sequencing (HT-Seq)
 - DNA-Seq
 - RNA-Seq
 - Exome-Seq
 - Ribosome Profiling
* Microarrays
 - Gene expression arrays
 - Exon arrays
 - Genotyping arrays
 - Copy number arrays
* ... and much more.

If you need help, don't hesitate to [contact] us. We are here to
support you and your research.

We also have long-term experience in methods and pipeline development,
which sometimes is needed, particularly in novel research projects.
We typically run these analyses on our large [compute cluster] here at
the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.
